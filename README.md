OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT PROJECT :DATA VISUALIZATION WITH BIG DATA TOOLS

Objective
To use Tableau or Power BI to visualize insights from a large dataset and create a set of interactive dashboards showcasing key insights.

Key Components
Data Preparation: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset.

Data Loading: Importing the dataset into Tableau or Power BI.

Visualization Creation: Designing and creating interactive visualizations.

Dashboard Creation: Combining visualizations into interactive dashboards.

Insight Presentation: Highlighting key insights in the dashboards.

Steps to Accomplish the Project
Using Tableau
Prepare the Dataset:

Clean and preprocess the dataset using Python, R, or any other tool.

Save the cleaned dataset in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, Excel).

Load the Dataset into Tableau:

Open Tableau and connect to the dataset.

Explore the data to understand its structure and relationships.

Create Visualizations:

Use Tableau’s drag-and-drop interface to create visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, heat maps, etc.

Customize visualizations with filters, colors, labels, and tooltips.

Create Interactive Dashboards:

Combine multiple visualizations into interactive dashboards.

Add interactivity using filters, actions, and parameters.

Present Key Insights:

Highlight key insights using annotations, titles, and descriptions.

Save and publish the dashboard to Tableau Public or Tableau Server.

Using Power BI
Prepare the Dataset:

Clean and preprocess the dataset using Python, R, or any other tool.

Save the cleaned dataset in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, Excel).

Load the Dataset into Power BI:

Open Power BI Desktop and import the dataset.

Explore the data to understand its structure and relationships.

Create Visualizations:

Use Power BI’s visualization tools to create charts, graphs, maps, etc.

Customize visualizations with filters, colors, labels, and tooltips.

Create Interactive Dashboards:

Combine multiple visualizations into interactive dashboards.

Add interactivity using slicers, filters, and drill-throughs.

Present Key Insights:

Highlight key insights using annotations, titles, and descriptions.

Publish the dashboard to Power BI Service or share it with others.

Expected Outcomes
Interactive Dashboards: A set of interactive dashboards showcasing key insights from the dataset.

Enhanced Data Understanding: Improved understanding of the dataset through visualizations.

Effective Communication: Clear and impactful presentation of insights to stakeholders.
